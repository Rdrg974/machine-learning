# BASE - MACHINE LEARNING

## Description

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform tasks without explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. The primary goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.
